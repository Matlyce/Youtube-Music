# Youtube Music for Windows
Simple Youtube Music App for Windows (with no features)
<br />
This application basically embed music.youtube.com into a Windows application (.exe)
<br />
<sub>This app was made in Python (using PyQt5), and compiled to an .exe app, so that's normal if the app is sometimes slow.</sub>
<br />
<br />
I have made this app just for fun, that's why i use Python, so be lenient about it, cause python is relatively slow by default :)
<br />
<sub> (but also because there is no Youtube Music application) </sub>

# Installation
**On Windows :**<br />
-> Move the app in a folder to this path on your computer :
```
C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
```
Then you can call the app with the start menu to launch it.

<br />
(you also can use it directly, because is a portable version, you just need to execute the .exe file)
